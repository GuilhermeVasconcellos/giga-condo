Residential Condominiums
My goal is to develop a simple software to register visitors to my condominium, by getting their name, photo, doc number, license plate, destination, and so on.
And, also. to create a scheduler for the party room for the condominium members.
I have just finish CS50 and I intend to apply this project as my final project for the course.
My plan is to use Python, Flask and sqlite (or MySQL).
